### Patch Changes

- d53d5b6: feat: optimize plugin system architecture

  - Standardize plugin factory pattern for consistent API across all plugins
  - Enhance framework configuration handling with comprehensive type safety
  - Move configuration validation responsibility from themes to plugins
  - Add structured configuration namespaces (posts, rss) with proper defaults
  - Improve error handling and graceful degradation when plugins fail
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations

  **Key improvements:**

  - Unified plugin declaration in themes: `plugins: [pluginPostsFrontmatter, pluginRSS]`
  - Enhanced `CogitaFullConfig` with framework metadata and smart defaults
  - Plugin-level configuration validation instead of theme-level
  - Structured configuration: `config.posts` and `config.rss`
  - Better TypeScript support with detailed type definitions

  **Migration notes:**

  - RSS plugin now auto-detects configuration from `config.rss` field
  - Posts plugin supports both new structured config and legacy direct access
  - Themes no longer need complex configuration handling logic
