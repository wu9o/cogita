# @cogita/theme-lucid

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md)

> A lucid, content-focused blog theme for Cogita. (Default Theme)

This is the default theme for Cogita, designed for clarity, readability, and a seamless writing experience.

## Features

- **Out-of-the-Box Post List**: The homepage is pre-configured to display a list of your latest blog posts, ready to go with zero configuration.
- **Automatic Integration**: This theme automatically includes and configures the `@cogita/plugin-posts-frontmatter` plugin, which is responsible for sourcing and providing the post data. As a user, you don't need to install or configure it manually.
- **Clean & Responsive Design**: A modern, mobile-first design that puts your content front and center.
- **Customizable**: While it works out-of-the-box, you can still customize its appearance and behavior through Cogita's configuration file.
