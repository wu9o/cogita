## Welcome to Cogita!

This is the first post on my new blog, powered by the **Cogita** framework. I'm incredibly excited to start this journey and share my thoughts with the world.

Cogita is designed to be a simple, powerful, and developer-friendly static site generator. It's built on modern technologies like Rspress, React, and TypeScript.

### What to Expect

On this blog, I plan to write about:

-   Web Development Tutorials
-   Deep Dives into JavaScript Frameworks
-   Thoughts on Software Architecture
-   Updates on the Cogita project itself

Stay tuned for more content!
